/*
 * Hey guys, so to use the different colors of hats/shirts/pants for the NPCs,
 * click on the model and open the "Material" tab on the right side. Then,
 * click on the circle button on the right side of materials and search for a
 * color (or just type out the type of clothing) and choose the type you want
 * the NPC to have. If you make a different combination, make sure to copy and
 * paste that into a new model otherwise it'll overrite all the NPCs using that
 * same model. Below are the clothing options to pick from:
 * 
 * SHIRTS:
 * Blue
 * Red (Search for "Playermodel")
 * Black
 * Green
 * White
 * 
 * JEANS:
 * Black
 * Blue (Search for "Playermodel")
 * 
 * HATS/SHOES:
