Known bugs: 

Slight visual bug during fishing mechanic. Shadow clips slightly for an unknown reason. Does not affect performance nor impact game mechanics.

NPCs can sometimes wander away from player reachable areas. No game mechanic impact outside of their dialogue.

Some fish are larger than would seem to be intended when holding. This is not a bug, but it may be seen as one. We just thought it was fun :)

If inventory is full when an item is given, the item will not be given. (Necessary when dealing with final game logic).

If item is taken / moved in inventory while it is selected in the hotbar, minor visual glitch where item is missing from holding spot. Fixed by reselecting hotbar slot. No game / mechanic impact.
